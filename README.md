# Rustland
A tiling window manager and Wayland compositor written in Rust with the aim of flexibility and powerful configuration.  Rustland is currently in the alpha stage so it will probably not fit your needs just yet.


### Currently implemented features
* Automatic window tiling
* Workspaces

### Features yet to come
* Command line application "rlctl" for interacting
* Possibility for interacting with the WM using TCP
* Configuration
* Modularity - some way of creating plugins

### Contribution
